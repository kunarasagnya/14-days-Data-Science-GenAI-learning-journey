Day 2 – Word Embeddings & BERT (SBERT) Introduction

This project covers the fundamental concepts of word embeddings and contextual sentence embeddings, forming the backbone of all modern NLP and LLM applications.
Using Word2Vec and Sentence-BERT, I explored how words and sentences can be represented as meaningful numerical vectors.

This is Day 2 of my 14-Day AI Learning Journey.
